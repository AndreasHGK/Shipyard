# Shipyard
Make and fly airships in Pocketmine-MP!

**shipyard has been discontinued** (for now?)


## About
This plugin is currently far from getting released.

Currently, this plugin will NEED **FactionsPro** to be installed.
It will not work without it. Later on I might suport normal survival as well.

## How to
select both outer corners of the ship by doing **/shipyard pos1**|**pos2**
To make the ship, do **/shipyard create**.
Now to select your ship, do **/shipyard control**.
Now that you have a ship, do **/shipyard get**.

You should obtain a ship controller. Right-click in the direction you want to go!
Have fun flying!
